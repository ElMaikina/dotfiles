Thanks for downloading the Just Edit OBS theme v2.4


Installing custom themesc
The best place to install custom themes is in your user directory - the same place where profiles and scenes are stored, so that if you ever reinstall OBS Studio, you don't lose your custom themes.

Windows: %APPDATA%\obs-studio\themes\
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/themes/
Linux: ~/.config/obs-studio/themes/
You may have to create the themes directory yourself.
