# Arc Theme

Arc is a flat theme with transparent elements for GTK 3, GTK 2 and various desktop shells, window managers and applications. It's well suited for GTK based desktop environments such as GNOME, Cinnamon, Xfce, Unity, MATE, Budgie etc.

The theme was originally designed and developed by [horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme), but the project has been unmaintained since May 2017.

This is my own fork that focuses on a black and compact theme.
